# EchoSight

## Problem Statement
EchoSight addresses the challenges faced by individuals with hearing impairments in perceiving and understanding conversation & environmental sounds. By leveraging advanced audio processing and machine learning techniques, our solution transforms audio cues into visual information displayed through OLED glasses, enhancing spatial awareness and safety for users.

## System Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. **Frontend**: React-based web application for user interface and audio capture
2. **Backend**: Python server handling audio processing and sound classification
3. **Hardware**: ESP32-based OLED glasses for visual display

```
User Input → Audio Capture → Sound Processing → Classification → Visual Display
```

## Instructions to Run the App

### Frontend Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SalinCodes/EchoSight.git
   cd EchoSight
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
